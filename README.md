# Fine-Tuning Phi-2 for Mental Health Applications

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the process of fine-tuning the Phi-2 language model for mental health-related tasks. The goal is to leverage advanced language understanding capabilities to assist in mental health applications such as sentiment analysis, therapy assistance, and early detection of mental health concerns.

## Key Features
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Demonstrates fine-tuning the Phi-2 model using a curated dataset.
- **Dataset Handling:** Preprocessing and exploration of the dataset tailored for mental health scenarios.
- **Training Pipeline:** Comprehensive training loop with evaluation metrics for monitoring performance.
- **Use Cases:** Highlights potential use cases in real-world applications, such as chatbot integration or textual analysis for mental health professionals.

## Notebook Structure
1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the project goals and the importance of AI in mental health.
2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Steps for data cleaning, tokenization, and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. **Model Configuration**
   - Configuration details for the Phi-2 model and hyperparameters used for fine-tuning.
4. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Training loop implementation with metrics like accuracy, loss, and validation performance.
   - Visualization of training progress.
5. **Results and Insights**
   - Analysis of the model's performance and limitations.
   - Discussion on ethical considerations in deploying AI for mental health.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is [marmikpandya](https://huggingface.co/datasets/marmikpandya/mental-health) from Hugging Face, containing 13,000 samples specifically curated for mental health applications.
